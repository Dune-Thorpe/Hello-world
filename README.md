# Hello-world
This repository is for practising the Git-Hub Flow
...I could follow the instructions as stated in the Tutorial, and "write abit about myself" but I'll not, because I have something better, a quote - which was forwarded to me on "Whatsup" the app. So here goes...
  "You have to act like a creator. Everyday. In everything you do. Don't just read. Write. Don't just listen. Speak. Don't just take. Give. Take inspiration- but through the lens of output. Once you make this shift, your life changes forever. You finally escape the sky-painted walls you've been trapped inside. Then, you make things. Relentlessly. Obsessively. And you wonder how you went so long without realizing that you always could."
